        <p>Pizza Home was launched on May 31, 1958, by two brothers, Dan and Frank Carney, both Wichita State students, as a single location in Wichita, Kansas. Six months later they opened a second outlet, and within a year they were operating six locations.

            One early employee was future Pro Football Hall of Fame head coach Bill Parcells, who had worked for the company while a college student and football player at Wichita State University. Parcells was considering a franchise for a career (as well as law school), but instead chose to enter coaching, eventually becoming a head coach in the National Football League.
            
            The brothers began franchising in 1959. The iconic Pizza Home building style was designed in 1963 by Chicago architect George Lindstrom and was implemented in 1969.</p>
